Las ondas de radio pueden ser recibidas tanto por un receptor FM como por un receptor AM (Los combencionales para escuchar
musica. Aqui ensenan a realizar un receptor FM con GNU Radio. 

Primer instrumento RTL: (PARA PARTE TEORICA/PRACTICA)

Step 1: What's RTL-SDR?
RTL-SDR is the cheapest method to get into the world of SDR (Software Defined Radio) - method of receiving 
(RTL-SDR have no capability to transmit) and processing radio transmission using your PC. Using it you can receive everything 
that is transmitted between about 20~2000 MHz depending on second chip on the device.
In brief it can hear i.e.:
- ordinary FM radio stations
- police radio transmissions
- plane and ship tracking informations
- small radio devices like car keys
- probably GPS satellites (as of now there is no confirmed method to do this)
- International Space Station and other space equipment that transmits below 2 GHz
- every other device that you know transmits on these frequencies


Despues de esto en el POST ponen algo de practica en cuanto a como lehicieron para lograr hacer funcionar el RTL en arch-linux.
(Parte practica)


Nota: La principal diferencia entre las diferentes marcas de los RTL esta en la capacidad de recepcion. Debido a que esto va 
conectado directamente a una antena creo que el cable coaxial sale de aqui.

1. Use Four Layers
Four-layer PCB prices have gone way down, and having unbroken power planes on the inside of your board makes your design 
simpler and makes for a consistent RF environment throughout. You could build it on a two-layer board, but then when it 
doesn’t work, you’re going to need that pricey test equipment. Keeping the layout simple, with RF traces all on top and power 
planes in the middle, is insurance against the gremlins.

Resumen: Utilizar PCBs de 4 capas es algo puramente practico que ayuda en la implementacion del diseno.


2. Use the Most Integrated Component Possible
Design your board around the most-integrated parts you can find. That’s going to mean picking an integrated transceiver IC 
that’s got everything in silicon. That’s a whole lot of tricky design work that you won’t have to do. The same applies to 
filters; you could spend hours designing a fancy filter and layout, or you could just find the right part ([Mike] likes SAW 
filters a lot) that fits your design.

Resumen: No inventar el agua azucarada. Utilizar lo que ya este implementado.

3. Design for 50 ohms Everywhere
Impedance matching: you just can’t get around it. Most manufacturers’ parts are built for 50 ohm inputs and outputs, though, 
so there’s no work for you to do there. Your only job is to make sure that the traces between the parts have a 50 ohm 
characteristic impedance. How do you do it? KiCad has a tool, and otherwise there’s the Internet. You just need to know some 
properties of your PCB from the manufacturer, plug them into a calculator, and then you get out a trace width that will give 
you 50 ohms across the board. Remember that unbroken power-plane in the second layer of your four-layer layup? It makes the 
same trace width work everywhere. That’s the hardest part of RF design, done.

Resumen: Esto es teoria pura, aqui tenes que estudiar mas sobre que se trata el diseno de 50 ohms. Que es el estandard de los 
50 ohms?

4. Follow Manufacturer Recommendations
What if you absolutely need to use a part that doesn’t work on a 50-ohm standard? Unless they don’t want your business, 
the manufacturer will provide you with a reference circuit that transforms the output to 50 ohms. Your job is to take 
advantage of the work of their applications engineers. There will often be a layout specified, sometimes even down to the part 
numbers. If they tell you how to get their chip’s input or output to work with a 50 ohm single-ended transmission line, you do 
it.

Resumen:

5. Route the RF Parts First
The RF signals are the most sensitive part of your circuit design. We already know what the desired RF trace width is, so all 
that’s left is laying them out. [Mike] advises you to keep the traces short, relative to the frequency of interest. After 
you’ve laid our your RF signals, keep your digital traces a little bit away from the RF traces whenever possible. That’s it.
